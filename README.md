Personal Project Alert
I built an AI Personal Assistant in Python that can actually TALK 🎙️

✨ Features:
• Voice input (speech recognition)
• Voice output (text-to-speech)
• Video-based animated assistant
• Desktop GUI application

It can:
🎙️ Listen to my voice
🧠 Understand the input
🗣️ Reply back with voice
🎥 Use a video-based avatar assistant to reply

🛠️ Tech Used:
Python | Tkinter | OpenCV | SpeechRecognition | pyttsx3(Text-to-Speech)

This project was a great learning experience in combining AI concepts with real-time user interaction.

Looking forward to improving it further 🚀
